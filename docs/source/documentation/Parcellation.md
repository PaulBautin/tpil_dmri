Brain parcellation was computed in two steps for every subject based on the Brainnetome atlas. First, gross cortical and subcortical parcellation was computed using FreeSurfer recon-all pipeline (version 7.2, run with 3 T data option) on the CBRAIN web based computing platform. Then, further brain region division was computed using freesurfer_flow according to the 249 parcel Brainnetome connectivity based atlas. 

## Parcellation
### group-average “hard” parcellations 
(Schaefer et al., 2018), 

### individual-specific “hard” parcellations 
(Kong et al., 2021a), 

### Individual-specific “soft” parcellation 
(spatial independent component analysis with dual regression; Beckmann et al., 2009). 

## Gradient
## principal gradients 
(Margulies et al., 2016)



## Brainnetome
Brain Atlas Based on Connectional Architecture and mapped the delineated structures to mental processes by reference to the BrainMap database.
The Brainnetome Atlas thus provides a new framework for human brain research and in particular connectome analysis that overcomes several drawbacks of previous parcellation schemes: 1) it establishes a priori, biologically valid brain parcellation scheme of the entire cortical and subcortical gray matter into subregions showing a coherent pattern of anatomical connections, 2) it provides detailed characterizations of the structural and functional connectivity patterns for these, and 3) it decodes brain functions by establishing those tasks and contrasts that activated the respective area above chance in previous task-based functional neuroimaging studies.
