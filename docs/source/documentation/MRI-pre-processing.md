MRI preprocessing was applied on DWI and T1-w images using TractoFlow. Overall, DWI pre-processing serves the preparation of images to the application of local reconstruction models. It is mainly composed of : denoising, eddy/topup, brain extraction, N4 Bias Correction, cropping, normalization, resampling. On the other hand, T1-w images preprocessing serves the computation of tracking maps, seeding masks and brain parcellation. Its main steps consist in: denoising, brain extraction, N4 Bias Correction, cropping and resampling.
