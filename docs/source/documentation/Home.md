The starting point and aim of this project is to use diffusion MRI to improve our understanding of chronic pain and its treatment.

## Study of white matter and associanism
* Reil and Burdach: first anatomical description of white matter and tracts. They were fascinated by shelling’s natural philosophy and inspired the functional interpretation and speculative reflection on the observed connections.
* Meynert: first classification of white matter tracts. Psychiatrist proposed projection and association connection system
purely morphologic data + a single pathological anatomical fact  helps explain how labor is distributed in the brain.
Distinctly limited and functionally separated portions of the cortex thus connections must play a role in brain function
* Carl Wernicke: First to bring the associationist model to the clinic by applying the disconnection paradigm to explain cognitive disorders in neurology and psychiatry. 
Corollary: If higher functions arise through associative connections, disorders of higher function must derive from their breakdown.
Ex. Lichtheim house, Charcot’s “bell” diagram
Ex. aphasia, agraphia, apraxia
Neurosurgeons take interest in anatomical models of mental disorders as they provide the rationale for possible surgical treatment of psychiatric patients.
* Geschwind: neo-associationist school. Behavioral neurologist
* Connectomics: look for Olaf Sporns
