Requirements
------------

- [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io)
- [scilpy](https://github.com/scilus/scilpy)

Singularity/Docker
-----------
If you are on Linux, we recommend using the Singularity to run tractometry_flow pipeline.
If you have Singularity == 3.*, launch your Nextflow command with:
`-with-singularity scilus/scilus:1.2.0_tractometryflow-1.0.0`

If you have rebuild singularity Singularity == 2.* image is available [here](http://scil.dinf.usherbrooke.ca/en/containers_list/scilus-1.2.0_tractometryflow-1.0.0.img)
Launch your Nextflow command with: `-with-singularity ABSOLUTE_PATH/scilus-1.2.0_tractometryflow-1.0.0.img`

If you are on MacOS or Windows, we recommend using the Docker container to run tractometry_flow pipeline.
Launch your Nextflow command with:
`-with-docker scilus/scilus:1.2.0_tractometryflow-1.0.0`

Usage
-----

See *USAGE* or run `nextflow run main.nf --help`
